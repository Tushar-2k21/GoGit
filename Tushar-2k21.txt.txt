"shutter island" "the catcher in the rye"
shutter island has mind bending ending which would take you by surprise as it took me which does'nt happen usually
the catcher in the rye is a classic , it explore the deep feelings of a teenage mind and that everything
can be expressed with a single adjective "phony"' which is on every page of this book.lol
